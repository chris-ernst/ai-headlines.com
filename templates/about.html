        <p class="text-slate-700 md:text-3xl text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Does It Work?</p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">This project is meant to be an experiment showcasing AI news generation and illustration. Text headlines are generated by OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5" target="_blank" class="underline">GPT-3.5Turbo</a>, which also powers ChatGPT. Based on the resulting headline, an image prompt is fed to Prompthero's  <a href="https://huggingface.co/prompthero/openjourney" target="_blank" class="underline">Openjourney</a>. Openjourney is a version of StableDiffusion finetuned on Midjourney outputs. After some prompt magic, the resulting outputs are what you see on the website â€“ without any human intervention. </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">All of this runs as a Python Flask app together with a PostgreSQL database in the back and TailwindCSS in the front.</p>

        <p class="text-slate-700 md:text-3xl text-2xl font-bold mb-4">A Note On Content Moderation</p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">While both GPT3.5 and StableDiffusion have content filters in place, there is inherent bias in any AI system. This means, that there is a non-zero chance that either the text content, the image content or the interplay between both elements of a news article may be perceived as offensive by some. In that case, please let the site admins know by flagging any insensitive content. </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Also an opportune time to publish a disclaimer: This platform and its content are meant as an experiment and do not intend to make any political statement. </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700 md:text-3xl text-2xl font-bold mb-4">But Why Build It?</p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">As a web developer, I am always seeking new and innovative ways to create engaging and dynamic websites. My motivation to build a speculative news website featuring AI-generated text and image content is rooted in my desire to push the boundaries of what is possible in web development. By utilizing the power of AI, we can create a website that is not only visually stunning but also highly informative and accurate. Furthermore, by using AI to generate content, we can potentially streamline the content creation process, freeing up time and resources to focus on other aspects of website development. Overall, my motivation is to create a website that is not only cutting-edge but also highly valuable to users, providing them with accurate and timely news coverage that they can rely on. <span class="italic">(This paragraph was generated by ChatGPT).</span></p>

        <p class="text-slate-700 md:text-3xl text-2xl font-bold mb-4">No Seriously, Why Build It?</p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">I want to investigate how far we can automate content generation without getting into uncanny valley territory. Of course the content has to be mildly entertaining and visually appealing, so there is an interesting challenge regarding prompt design and its dynamic generation. Finally, since there is a bias in any AI system, I wanted to see how far this unlikely duo of AI models can make it without producing something offensive. So far they are doing better than I expected. </p>
