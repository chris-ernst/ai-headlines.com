        <p class="text-lg mb-4">I want to investigate how far we can automate content generation without getting into uncanny valley territory. Of course the content has to be mildly entertaining and visually appealing, so there is an interesting challenge regarding prompt design and its dynamic generation. Finally, since there is a bias in any AI system, I wanted to see how far this unlikely duo of AI models can make it without producing something offensive. So far they are doing better than I expected. </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700 md:text-3xl text-2xl font-bold mb-4">But Why Build It?</p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">As a creative technologist, my motivation to build a speculative news website that features AI-generated text and image content stems from the belief that we are on the cusp of a new era of media consumption. With advancements in machine learning and natural language processing, AI-generated content has the potential to provide consumers with a more personalized and engaging experience. By harnessing the power of AI, we can create news articles and multimedia content that are not only informative but also interactive and immersive. Additionally, AI-generated content can help reduce the cost of content production, enabling smaller publishers to compete with larger media organizations. Overall, I am excited about the potential of AI-generated content to revolutionize the way we consume news and information. <span class="italic">(This paragraph was generated by ChatGPT).</span></p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">While both GPT3.5 and StableDiffusion have content filters in place, there is inherent bias in any AI system. This means, that there is a non-zero chance that either the text content, the image content or the interplay between both elements of a news article may be perceived as offensive by some. In that case, please let the site admins know by flagging any insensitive content. </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Also an opportune time to publish a disclaimer: This platform and its content are meant as an experiment and do not intend to make any political statement. </p>

        <p class="text-slate-700 md:text-3xl text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Does It Work?</p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">This project is meant to be an experiment showcasing AI news generation and illustration. Text headlines are generated by OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5" target="_blank" class="underline">GPT-3.5Turbo</a>, which also powers ChatGPT. Based on the resulting headline, an image prompt is fed to Prompthero's  <a href="https://huggingface.co/prompthero/openjourney" target="_blank" class="underline">Openjourney</a>. Openjourney is a version of StableDiffusion finetuned on Midjourney outputs. After some prompt magic, the resulting outputs are what you see on the website â€“ without any human intervention. </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">All of this runs as a Python Flask app together with a PostgreSQL database in the back and TailwindCSS in the front.</p>
